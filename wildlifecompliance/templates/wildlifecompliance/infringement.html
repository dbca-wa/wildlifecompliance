                <p>
                    DBCA is committed to protecting Western Australia's parks, forests and reserves for wildlife conservation, sustainable recreation, and tourism. 
                    Our officers may issue infringement notices for alleged contraventions of the Conservation and Land Management Act 1984, Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 or Swan and Canning Rivers Management Act 2006. 
                    These laws cover a wide range of issues such as unlawful camping practices, license breaches, unlawful taking of flora and bringing animals into prohibited areas.

                                An infringement notice is a notice issued by DBCA setting out the particulars of an alleged contravention. The amount payable in an infringement notice is significantly lower than the penalty that a court could impose in relation to the alleged contravention upon conviction. 
                            <br><br> A person who is given an infringement notice can choose to pay the amount specified in the infringement notice as an alternative to court proceedings. If the person does not choose to pay the amount, further costs may be incurred, or court proceedings can be brought against them in relation to the alleged contravention.
                            <br><br>If you pay the penalty in full and on time, your liability for the alleged contravention is discharged. Paying an infringement notice is not regarded as an admission for the purposes of any civil or criminal court case.
